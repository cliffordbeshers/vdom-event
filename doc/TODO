* GHCJS hello world working with jquery/bootstrap server

* manifest as web module

needs association of url's of js, css, etc and content. for this I think the WebImport MimeType
(baseFilePath,relativeFilePath, bytestring) needs to be reinstated.

** assembly of the manifest serverpart will have to be done during the compilation phase.

zip (map relativePaths assets) (map checksum assets), where assets are anything needed offline, which I think means any javascript/css referenced in the application template and any files

On the client side, could generate test function that downloads all the resources and compares the checksums, although presumably the browser does that as well.
That would be a #ifdef in compileWebModule or whatever it is called.

* ajax as webmodule a, client and server side.
