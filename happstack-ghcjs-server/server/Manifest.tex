The manifest lists all the resources that are needed for offline
execution.

I want to use the same mechanism to ensure that the application
reloads when the server updates.

For now, I will turn off caching for the url /manifest.cache so that
the browser is forced to go back for it.

-- This code is buggy.  getCurrentTime is only run if *THIS MODULE IS RECOMPILED.*
-- In order to ensure that it is updated for every run, we have to touch this source file.
-- The correct answer is to append the checksums of every file as a comment to it's reference in the manifest.

buildDate :: Text
buildDate = Text.pack $(runIO getCurrentTime >>= lift . show)
