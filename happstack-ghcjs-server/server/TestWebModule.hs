-- Compiling the website should generate an html page that is attached to defaultHandler and indexDotHtml.
-- That html page should include all the headers and bodies.

-- The client generated .js file should be referenced in one of those headers.

-- So I need a website that compiles the client code and the appropriate headers and serverparts.

-- That file should be loaded with Template haskell (server only) and attached to the 
-- defaultHandler and indexDotHtml.

-- This should be compiled with ghcjs, functions that generate dom
-- There should be a path for the client code returned by something that compiles the website
